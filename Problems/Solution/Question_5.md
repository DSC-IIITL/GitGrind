# Splitting Ranges into Two Groups

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` where `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` denotes that all integers between `starti` and `endi` (both inclusive) are contained in the ith range.

You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:

- Each range belongs to exactly one group.
- Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.
- Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```
ranges = [[6,10],[5,15]]
```

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**
The two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.
Thus, there are two possible ways:
- Put both the ranges together in group 1.
- Put both the ranges together in group 2.

## Example 2

**Input:**

```
ranges = [[1,3],[10,20],[2,5],[4,8]]
```

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**
Ranges [1,3], and [2,5] are overlapping. So, they must be in the same group.
Again, ranges [2,5] and [4,8] are also overlapping. So, they must also be in the same group.
Thus, there are four possible ways to group them:
- All the ranges in group 1.
- All the ranges in group 2.
- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 1 and [10,20] in group 2.
- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 2 and [10,20] in group 1.

## Constraints

- 1 <= ranges.length <= 105
- ranges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 109
