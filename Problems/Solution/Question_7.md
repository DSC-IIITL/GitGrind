# Statement:

You are given a list of words. Write a function to find the word with the most anagrams in the list and return that word.

**Input:**
- A list of words, `word_list`, where 1 <= len(word_list) <= 1000.
- Each word in the list is a string consisting of lowercase letters.

**Output:**
- A string representing the word with the most anagrams in the list. If there are multiple words with the same maximum number of anagrams, return any one of them.

### Example:

**Input:**
word_list = ["listen", "silent", "hello", "lovers", "siren"]

**Output:**
listen

**Explanation:**
In the given list, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other. No other words in the list have anagrams. "listen" has the most anagrams, so it is the output.
